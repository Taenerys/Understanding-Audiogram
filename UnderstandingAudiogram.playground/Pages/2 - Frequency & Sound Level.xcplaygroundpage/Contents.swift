 # Frequency & Sound Level

 - important: Please remember to DISABLE **"Enable Results"** before running this page! I noticed that if we don't disable that, there would be **an error** running this page. In this case, just start over and disable **"Enable Results"**, then try again!

 Now, let's dive into *two pillars* of audiogram: **Frequency** and **Sound Level** (or **Hearing Level** - they are basically the same thing!)

 ## Frequency

 **Frequency** or **pitch** is measured in **Hertz (Hz)**. Frequencies range from **low pitch** to **high pitch** and read from left to right on the audiogram. Each **vertical line** represents a different frequency, such as 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz.

 Basically, **how high a sound is**.

 Here you can find on the right is a **basic visualizer** for the frequencies.

- note: Please **tap on + or -** to switch between **different frequencies** and **play their sounds** accordingly! If you want to stop the sound, tap **Stop**. If you want to start playing again, go ahead and tap on + or - again!

 ---

 ## Sound Level

 The **sound level** is measured in **decibels (dB)**. It relates to **how loud or soft** a sound is. Each **horizontal line** represents a different intensity level. The **softest ** sounds are at the top of the chart and the **loudest** sounds at the bottom. Each mark on your audiogram shows the softest sounds you can hear. The softest intensity tested is typically 0 dB and the loudest is 120 dB.

 Basically, **how loud a sound is.**

 - note: Below the frequency visualizer, I made a few flashcards for **some common sound levels and their real world examples**. **Have fun tapping it and learn**! If you run the Playground on **Mac** the tapping can feel **a little laggy**. I would recommend trying to **run it again** and **stop the frequency visualizer** first!

 (**Pro tip**: it looks pretty satisfying if you tap on the cards in order - it would like a beautiful rainbow wave üåà‚ù§Ô∏è)

 Now tap **Next** to check out an actual audiogram!
