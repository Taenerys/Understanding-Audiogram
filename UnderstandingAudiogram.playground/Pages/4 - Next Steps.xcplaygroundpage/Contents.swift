 # What's Next?
 
 - Consult your audiologist if you need to confirm anything about your audiogram! This guide is just for your own understanding. 🥸
 - Take care of your hearing! Pay attention to the most beautiful sounds out there. 👂 Live life. Be mindful of your sound exposure. 🐚

    **Apple** has some really cool features for [hearing accessibility](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/hearing/) ⭐️. Check them out! Here are some of my personal favourites:

    - [Made for iPhone Hearing aids](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201466) : I have been using them for years and literally cannot live without them! I applied my audiologist’s environmental presets (which they can set using.... you got it... **AUDIOGRAMS**!) to apply to my hearing aids, and it just... works. Thanks to these small yet powerful devices, I find myself enjoying listening to music and (some) phone calls (!!!!), things I’ve never thought I can do.
    - If you are an Apple Watch user, they have [Noise app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209593) which is super cool! It tracks decibel levels of the ambient sounds around you, helping you identify when the levels in your environment could negatively affect your hearing. If sounds around you are too loud, Apple Watch alerts you so that you can move to a quieter area.
 
 - If you find your hearing is slowly getting worse, your audiologist is your friend! Talk to them and have them advise you on how to proceed! Here are some great resources I think will be valuable to you:

     - 🦻 [Hearing aids option](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/in-depth/hearing-aids/art-20044116)
     - 🐚 [Cochlear implant option](https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/professionals/surgical-resources/surgical-guides)
